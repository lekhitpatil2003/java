Types of inheritance:
    1.Single inheritance
        - it allows (derived class) child class to reuse propertys and methods of parent class (Base class)
        - insted of rewriting the same code with multiple palces we allows child class to reuse the parent properties and methods.
        - Parent > Child

        Syntax:
            class Parent {
                //properties and methods
            }
            class Child extends Parent{
                //additional properties and method
            }

    2.Multi-level inheritance
        - Parent > Child > GrandChild

    3.Hierachical inheritance
    4.multiple inheritance (Not supported by java but we can achieve this by interface)
