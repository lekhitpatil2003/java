Class :-
    - class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.
    - class is a collection of variable, objects, methods.
    - class consist of state and behavier of object.
    - class dosent occupy the memory until the objectis created.
    - objects can not  exist with a class but class can existwithout any object.
    - class name always start with upper-case 

syntax of class:
    access_modifer class class_name{
        state
        behavier / methods
    }




Objects :- 
    - object is instance of class that has state and behavier
    - object always occupy memory.
    - it is a run time entity.
    eg. think of class is a recipie and object as a actual think that is created using that recipie book.
    
    syntax of object : 
        ClassName objName = new ClassName();

vehicle :
    state : Color → Red / Blue
            Speed → 60 km/h
            Fuel Level → 20 liters
            Engine Status → ON / OFF
            Model → Honda City
    
    behavier : startEngine()
            stopEngine()
            accelerate()
            brake()
            refuel()

bank account :
    state : Account Number
            Account Holder Name
            Balance
            Account Type
            IFSC Code
    
    Behavior : deposit()
            withdraw()
            checkBalance()
            transfer()


Method :- A block of code the perform specific task and work.
Adv :- Code Become Re-usable, code become modular (Divide into smaller part), Easy to read / test / mentain, 
Dis-Adv :- 


Access_Modifer: 
- Public, Private, Protected, Default

Syntax :- 
    public class Demo {
        access_modifer return_type Method_name (){

        }
    }

1. Method with no return Type
    -> A method dose not return any value.
    -> Eg. Sending OTP.
2. Method with return Type
    -> A method that returns a value to the caller (Main Method).
3. method with parameter
    -> A method that accept input values.
4. method with no parameter
    -> A method dose not take any input.
5. Static Method
    -> A method that belongs to the class not to object.
6. Instance  Method
    ->

Why your main method is always static ?
-> because the JVM calls it without creating an object of the class.
-> static means it dose not change its state. when we put static in front of somethings (varable, method, class).
-> it means this things belongs to the class not to the any object
-> it will have only one copy. only one copy of that member (class, ) exist in a memory regardless of how many object of the class you created
-> we access without created object using class name, member name
